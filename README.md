triggershift
============

Trigger Shift (triggershift.org) worked with young people in North East England and some of the best programmers and designers in the world to create something groundbreaking.
It was fundamentally built around encouraging and enabling the use of consumer technology to create, rather than just consume.
Trigger Shift relied on a whole bunch of extremely talented and dedicated people releasing code under opensource licenses. This includes openNi, osceleton, and a lot of extremely cool stuff from the creative community of openframeworks. Here's the code: github.com/memo/triggershift
