\f0\fs24 \cf0 Good people of [insert country here]. I know I promised you to fix the economy and give tramps work and save precious cats from trees. But, I lied. This is my country [flag with red x painted on falls behind], and my rules. No new hair styles, no new clothes, no end to the recession. [pics of topic are showing while this is being said.] Don\'92t think of running to the police or fleeing the country because you won\'92t be able to. No marriage for gays, hell lets even say no dating for em. No trips to the moon or visiting American/European websites. I am here to stay, not just for 8 years or whatever no, forever. Selected by people you\'92ve never heard about, I am here. Welcome to [country], welcome to me! \
